Frontend for LeetCode submissions

## TODO

- [done] convert existing leetcode submissions json to new schema
- add "populate from existing submission" button for problems already solved in another language
- put "about this site" link on problem.html
- make dropdown for language selection based on existing languages used across all problems
- put all languages on languages.html like tags.html
- page to see stats over time and/or charts based on date, language, etc.
- go back and redo a bunch of python solutions in rust as practice
